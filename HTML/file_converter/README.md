# Mystery File Converter
## By Sergio Insuasti and Jun Wei Tay

### About
This project was created as part of a hackathon themed around Terrible Ideas.
This mystery file converter will take in a file and then convert to a mystery
file type from a list of predetermined types (.wav, .zip, .txt, .csv).
Further to this, additional features such as fallback links/files were created
in case of corrupted conversions, error on conversion etc.
