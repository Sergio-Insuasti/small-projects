# Pomodoro Timer App
## By Sergio Insuasti

### About
This is a quick app that uses the Pomodoro Timer system, a study system that
implements study sessions of length 25 minutes, alternating with 5 minutes break.
Once initiated, the time remaining is displayed and continues to count down to zero,
even on page refresh.
Once a session is complete, a sound automatically plays.
